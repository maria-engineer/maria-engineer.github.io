Coaching is an opportunity to\n          dive deep into what truly drives you, uncover the core challenges\n          you're facing, and identify the path forward. Together, we can\n          discover the key areas that matter most to you. And then enable action\n          to get to those important goals.\n        </StoryDiv>\n        <h2>My areas of expertise</h2>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          I believe the only constant in life is change. I have experienced my\n          fair share of change, and along the way I have become more resilient\n          to it. I learned how to use even the undesired change to lead me to\n          the places that I wanted to. Sometimes quite literally. I can help you\n          navigate change, and how to use it to chase what you want. I myself\n          have gone through a career change, multiple changes of company, and\n          lived as an immigrant in three countries. Every move came with its own\n          challenges and excitement.\n        </StoryDiv>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          With a background in Computer Science from Oxford University, I\n          entered the fast-paced tech world, thriving in the dynamic environment\n          at Facebook. But after exploring different company sizes—startups,\n          consultancies, and beyond, I realized my passion for coaching.\n          Regardless of the technology or the organization, I saw that the core\n          challenges people faced were deeply human. As a problem solver, I have\n          come to believe that the most powerful part of coaching is helping\n          uncover what the true problem or goal is. Only then can we efficiently\n          spend our energy to reach it.\n        </StoryDiv>\n        <h2>Coaching with me</h2>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          Currently I offer the following program:{\" \"}\n          <Link to=\"/coaching-reinvention/\">\n            Reinvent Yourself After a Major Life Change\n          </Link>\n          .
