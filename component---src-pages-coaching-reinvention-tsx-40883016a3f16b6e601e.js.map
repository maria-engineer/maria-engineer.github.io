Some of these challenges we might expect, while others\n          come as a complete surprise. But no matter the cause, they can all\n          feel destabilizing. It's easy to slip into survival mode, grabbing at\n          the first thing that feels familiar just to get through the moment.\n          While this might work temporarily, it often brings us back to square\n          one—just a little later on. In this coaching program, we will work\n          through the emotions and confusion that arise from these changes.\n        </StoryDiv>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          We'll create time and space for deep reflection, helping you analyze\n          your values and uncover what has shifted within you during this period\n          of transition. With this clarity, you will learn how to respond\n          thoughtfully and intentionally to the changes in your life, rather\n          than simply reacting to them.\n        </StoryDiv>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          As Viktor Frankl famously said, “When we are no longer able to change\n          a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.” By learning to\n          respond in a way that aligns with your core values and interests,\n          you'll be empowered to rebuild your life and create the future you\n          truly desire.\n        </StoryDiv>\n        <h2>Is this program for you?</h2>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          This program was designed from my own experiencing dealing with\n          layoffs, divorce, moving countries and working with other people whose\n          roles have unexpectedly changed. If you have recently been fired,\n          gotten laid off, lost funding, going through a divorce, or other major\n          life changes... this program will help you focus on building the life\n          you want using these changes and setbacks to fuel it. If you are\n          willing to take a deep dive into what you can currently do and what\n          makes you happy, this program is for you.\n        </StoryDiv>\n        <h2>The program</h2>\n        <h3>Session 1: The Why?</h3>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          Exploring what we want and how we want our life to look\n        </StoryDiv>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          In this first session, we'll dive into your “why”—the deeper reasons\n          behind your desire for change. What is it that truly matters to you?\n          What values, passions, and goals do you want to bring forward into\n          this new phase of your life? This session sets the foundation for\n          clarity, helping you visualize the life you want to build moving\n          forward.\n        </StoryDiv>\n\n        <h3>Session 2: The What?</h3>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          Exploring options and aligning them with what matters most to you\n        </StoryDiv>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          Now that you have a clearer sense of what matters, we'll explore\n          different possibilities for the future. We'll assess options in both\n          your personal and professional life, evaluating how they align with\n          your core values. By understanding your options through this lens,\n          you'll be able to make informed choices that align with your deepest\n          desires.\n        </StoryDiv>\n\n        <h3>Session 3: The How?</h3>\n        <StoryDiv>Turning your aspirations into actionable steps</StoryDiv>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          With a clearer sense of your \"why\" and \"what,\" we'll now explore the\n          \"how.\" How can you start taking steps toward your vision? We'll create\n          a concrete action plan, breaking down large goals into smaller,\n          manageable tasks. This session will give you the tools to start making\n          progress in a way that feels aligned and achievable.\n        </StoryDiv>\n\n        <h3>Session 4: The What Now?</h3>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          Identifying missing pieces and filling in the blanks\n        </StoryDiv>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          At this point, you may find there are gaps between where you are and\n          where you want to be. What's missing in your current plan? This\n          session will help identify and address these gaps, whether they are\n          skills, resources, mindset shifts, or practical steps. Together, we'll\n          ensure that everything you need to succeed is in place.\n        </StoryDiv>\n\n        <h3>Session 5: The Why Nots?</h3>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          Overcoming fears and uncovering what's holding you back\n        </StoryDiv>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          Change often brings fear and self-doubt. In this session, we'll tackle\n          any internal barriers standing in your way. Are there fears or\n          limiting beliefs preventing you from moving forward? Together, we'll\n          explore these obstacles, identify their root causes, and develop\n          strategies to overcome them, so you can move forward with confidence.\n        </StoryDiv>\n\n        <h3>Session 6: Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway</h3>\n        <StoryDiv>Empowering you to take the leap</StoryDiv>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          In our final session, we'll wrap up everything you've learned and\n          accomplished. You've explored your values, mapped out your path, and\n          tackled your fears. Now, it's time to take action. This session is all\n          about empowering you to step forward, even when fear is present, and\n          to embrace the change with confidence. You'll leave this program with\n          the tools, mindset, and courage to make lasting change.\n        </StoryDiv>\n        <h2>The Logistics</h2>\n        <h3>How we start</h3>\n        <StoryDiv>\n          Let's book a free introductory 30-minute call together to see if you think\n          we're a good fit to work together.
