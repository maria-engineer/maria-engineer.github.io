One may look at China, North Korea and other countries where censorship plays a great part in the consuption of media, and the play is open about gathering inspiration from the fake weddings and funerals over there that are used to distribute illegal art. However no-one ever mentions where this play is set, rightfully so, because it could be anywhere.

So maybe this play is potentially a matter of the past.
