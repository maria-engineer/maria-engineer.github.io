That if they know something everyone else must know something. Especially the adults. This attitude pops up in pantomimes where the children shout at the stage \"He's behind you!\". There is both frustration that they don't realise something so obvious to them, and a moment of realisation that what is obvious to them may not be obvious to someone else.

But sometimes there are no easy to find answers. So ask. And jot those answers down for the next person who joins the team. I think it is important to foster an environment to let new joiners ask the stupid questions, because every once in a while the "stupid question" is actually an insight based on a very diverse experience.
