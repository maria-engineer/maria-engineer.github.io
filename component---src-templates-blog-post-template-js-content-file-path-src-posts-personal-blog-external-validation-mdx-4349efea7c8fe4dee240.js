We rely on the reactions of others to determine what our response should be. Not all the time, but a lot of the time.

Maladaptive external validation seeking occurs, in my opinion, when it becomes the only driving factor. Moreover, the guilt that is supposed to help us make better choices is turned to shame. We become ashamed of who we are, never being enough, trying to change who we are, not because of harming others or wanting something different, but because of shame telling us we, as people, are wrong somehow.
