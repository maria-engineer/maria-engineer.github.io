Some surveyors had complicated names, each offering different packages none entirely clear about which you should get and why.\n\n## What the surveys actually mean\nThere's a lot of names for it, and some companies want to come on top of others by sometimes offering slightly different names.\n### Level 1 - Condition Report\nCheapest. It will let you know of the overall condition of the house.\nOnly worth doing if: the building is newer than 10 years, thus still under builder's guarantee, and the building has not been altered from the original, thus still under the builder's guarantee and it appears to have been reasonably maintained by the owners. So not in too many cases overall.\n### Level 2 - Homebuyer's Report\nThis is the most commonly recommended report. Apart from the Level 1 details, it includes a valuation of the property. It additionally will include points needing maintenance, and legal concerns that may be faced.\n### Level 3 - Building Survey\nThe most thorough survey most surveyors only recommend it for very old buildings or buildings in very bad condition. Strangely I had the sales team of one surveyor verbally abuse me over wanting a building survey despite them recommending a Level 2 survey. If this happens to you please walk away. The building survey will include more detailed technical observations on the property as well as the Level 1 and Level 2 details. With one caveat. Most Level 3 surveys will not include a valuation report. I was not too worried on that matter as one can always commission that separately, as well as the bank doing a valuation report anyway. (if you're getting a mortgage)\n\n## What are they needed for\nA house purchase. Well, technically a house purchase does not need a survey to take place. As a result it is often presented as something to have for peace of mind. However they have a few extra implications.\n* **Insurance**: reading the fine print of my building's insurance I discovered that unless the house was newer than 10 years, the insurance would not cover anything going wrong with the building due to its own existence (damp, termite infestation, etc...) unless a level 3 survey was taken out\n* **Lawyers**: Sometimes the previous buyers didn't do their due diligence, sometimes the records just get lost, but a survey points out the structural walls or potentially problematic intersections with the neighbours (e.g. bit of their drain comes over your wall and it's leaking, they have a mature tree in their garden whose roots could affect your foundations...). All these issues are covered, usually by the party wall act, however if something goes wrong whose responsibility is it to fix it? Surveyors will find these issues and send to the lawyers to investigate\n* **Identifying works**: There's sometimes some time between seeing the property and getting the survey in. And a lot can happen in that time, or maybe you were so amazed by the shiny chandelier you didn't notice there was a pipe leaking next to it. A survey will tell you what works are needed, and how badly.\n* **Red flags**: Sometimes the survey finds issues that could be deal breakers. e.g. the entire place is slanted, and further investigations show that the land is sliding.\n* **Money**: At the end of the day a house purchase is one if not the biggest expense one will have in their life. Getting as much details on what that money is spent on is invaluable, and not only will it open the gates to negotiations on price, if needed, help you walk away if there are glaring problems, but also ensure the resell-ability of the property.\n\n## Conclusion\nI ended up going for a Level 3 Building Survey. It was the first property I ever purchased so I chose to be more cautious.It later turned out that the first insurance company that would do cover between exchange and completion that we found, required it.
