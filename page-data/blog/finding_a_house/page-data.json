We kept checking and double checking we knew what we had to do, yet still we missed things. Thankfully we got a good solicitor who reminded us of requirements as well as sorted things out for us when needed. Yet in my searches I didn't find a complete list of all the things needed to be done. I shall attempt to add yet another list to all those, so maybe eventually there will be an intersection that is complete.</p>\n<h2>0.0 The search</h2>\n<p>Step one is starting to look for places. You can either look yourself on websites like Zoopla and RightMove, or if you have money to spare, hire a buyer's agent who will do the search for you. The median time in the UK from starting to look to completing (that is getting the keys) is 6 months. For me it is going to be just under 10 months however. The search should continue even after you've found a place, until you have your offer accepted, and passively keeping an eye out until exchange.</p>\n<h2>0.1 Talking to a mortgage broker</h2>\n<p>Talking to mortgage brokers is a free first step to do. I've talked to two. One recommended by an agent of a place we ended up not going for, and another recommended by a co-worker. Ended up going with the latter as they seemed more professional and more knowledgeable. The initial talk will give you an idea of how much you can borrow in some orders of magnitude. Once you decide on a broker they will ask you to send them your financials and they'll get you a few estimates on how much you can afford.</p>\n<p>The fees of the mortgage broker were 1,000Â£ for us. Which due to us taking quite a while to exchange, the brokers probably ended up making it back for us many times over. Because it took us so long to exchange the mortgage rates changed, and they reapplied for us when the rates went down from 1.55% to 1.25%. I would say a mortgage broker is 100% worth it.</p>\n<p>Note: The mortgage rates here were and are below inflation. In this case even if we hypothetically had all the money outright it would still have been beneficial to take out a mortgage.</p>\n<h2>0.2 Choosing an area</h2>\n<p>Eventually focusing on an area makes it easier to keep an eye on the places coming and going on the market. I was looking at one point at places all around London, but there was way too much, and I had too little information on the area. Not to mention arranging viewings was a lot harder for anything further away. As a result we decided to keep looking within the area we were currently living in. Not only did this have the advantage of us already knowing the area, and its peculiarities, but also we could walk to the viewings and walk around the place a different points in the day to figure out whether it was loud, or busy.</p>\n<h2>1.0 Finding the place</h2>\n<p>Great so we've found a place. This is good, we now need to do some extra research. We had 3 places on the short list, 2 of which we made offers on.</p>\n<p>This is the place where you can start talking to solicitors to see if they have availability.</p>\n<h2>1.1 Researching the place</h2>\n<p>A lot of investigation on places cost money. But there are stuff one can do for free to figure out details about the place that could affect its value, resell-ability, risks, etc. Here's what I looked at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Area prices</strong>: Zoopla allows you to search for <a href=\"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/market/uk/\">house prices in certain areas</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/home-values/\">specific estimates on properties</a>. These are generally automatically scraped from the land registry. What I looked at, all the houses on the street: how much they were sold for in the past, how much they increased by, are they currently being rented out, if so for how much. (the latter is not available on the land registry but if the property was listed on Zoopla for rent, they'll have that information). Sometimes you get lucky and get to see some photos from previous listings on Zoopla. These may give away how well the place was maintained, if it had major renovations done to it,</li>\n<li><strong>Listing History</strong>: Now this is a tricky one. We had one place which I recognised that it had been re-listed because I was looking at listings for quite a while before actually seriously looking at buying a place. Sadly agents purge this data, and Zoopla as a result does not show it on the searches. And another that was listed with 5 different ages, all at different times (and some research showed on the oldest one it had been on the market for a year). The longer it has been on the market the more one can tell about it. Sometimes they are very wrong things that come out in surveys, sometimes the sellers are asking too much and won't budge. Asking the agent will rarely let you know how long a place has been on the market as it is not in their interest to reveal that. What they'll tell you is \"Oh, we've had this listing up for 2 weeks\"; what they're not telling you: \"But it's been listed with 2 different agents before, and the first one was 4 months ago\".</li>\n<li><strong>Look for noise sources</strong>: When we were looking for places we saw one that seemed lovely, but it was in the middle of the pandemic and on a Saturday. We then realised the place was in the middle of a pub (after the restrictions were lifted we realised it was a really popular pub) and a primary school. Meaning loud noises all around the clock. Train lines and factories could also be a thing to watch out for.</li>\n<li><strong>Crime reports</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.police.uk/pu/your-area/metropolitan-police-service/\">Easy free search</a> worth doing for peace of mind.</li>\n<li><strong>Other places on the market that were recently sold</strong>: Finding a place takes time, which means I got to see a whole bunch of places come and go, and Zoopla often shows prices they were asking for. While that is rarely what the places are worth, it starts to become obvious when someone is asking for too much.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional costs</strong>: Usually the agents should be able to answer questions about any additional costs. Sometimes they're not very good and they can't, I've chosen to outright avoid those agents. We once looked at a freehold, that we found out from another agent's listing that it had a service charge. The agent was unable to give us details on it but confirmed it existed. If the place is on a private road, is there a maintenance charge? What happens if you don't pay it? Is the place a leasehold, for how long is it valid and how much would it cost to renew it? What is the ground rent? Are there any service charges? Are these able to change, if so for how much per year?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.0 Making an offer</h2>\n<p>With the research done above I managed to approximate how much a place was worth. In both cases the places had been sold rather recently so making calculations on the value was a lot easier as it would likely be in line with the general increase of house prices.</p>\n<p>The first place we made an offer was asking for more than 30% over what these calculations were showing, without having done major renovation works. We decided to go on the higher band of what such estimate even so the seller never budged. The place was already on the market with the second agent, having been initially placed on the market 4 months before.</p>\n<p>The second place we made an offer on was the one we got. And there was a lot less uncertainty about it. We were the first and only people to see it on the market. This didn't play great in negotiations however, as the sellers knew if they got an offer that quickly, they would have gotten more if they got an offer from the first people to see it. We made an initial offer of a bit less. As they themselves had only bought it 4 years before, we made an offer that we estimated to be house cost + stamp duty. That was not acceptable, but we expected that. It would however have been irresponsible not to try to get a smaller price.</p>\n<p>We finally managed to knock 3% off the price. So not a lot. But after some research we worked out that that may have been favourable to the sellers. Apparently a lot of estate agents have it in their contract that if someone offers you asking price, then you are liable for their commission, even if you do not end up selling the place. Which is a risky move.</p>\n<p>Negotiation books can seem to be a lot more prescriptive on the matter. Do your research and figure out what the place is worth, knock 20-10% off that price and that's the point to start negotiations. Information on how long the place had been on the market comes in handy here. I can recommend <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156469-never-split-the-difference\">Never Split the Difference</a>. It explains how people can make decisions based on time pressures, as well as helping identify what to bring to the table. We had to offer flexibility moving in, and that was what got our offer accepted.</p>\n<h2>3.0 Buying the house</h2>\n<p>We thought finding a house was the hard part. Little did we know the gargantuan amount of paperwork needed to make it happen. I've written <a href=\"/blog/house_purchase\">another post here</a> on the steps we went through for it.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 10, 2021","slug":"/blog/finding_a_house","title":"How to Find a House to Buy a House in the UK","short":"Finding a house","category":"personal","keywords":["Experience","House","HousePurchase","England","UK","Finding","Search","Advice"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/finding_a_house"}},
