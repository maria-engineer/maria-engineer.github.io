I don't know how common this is in actual language usage, but the fact that there is a grammatical difference here I find fascinating. THIS is why I love learning (about) languages!

But sometimes one really wants to be exactly this rude, in this exact way. Like when they interrupted you to ask you a question that you were going to answer in the second half of the sentence anyway. Or you were already working on a solution, know what you are doing and didn\'t really need their input... In English the options to convey this meaning are just so limited. Maybe a sigh, or with an additional snarky "As I was saying before you interrupted". But this is either not clear enough in your meaning, or wastes precious time, that they already wasted with their question. To have the option in the grammar, one syllable away, is just beautiful.'))}var l=function(e){void 0===e&&(e={});const{wrapper:t}=Object.assign({},(0,i.RP)(),e.components);return t?r.createElement(t,e,r.createElement(o,e)):o(e)},s=n(88),u=n(1042);const c=(0,a.A)("h1",{target:"e17e5u5i1"})({name:"f58qsc",styles:"font-size:3rem;@media (max-width: 420px){min-font-size:24px;}text-align:right important!"}),h=(0,a.A)("div",{target:"e17e5u5i0"})({name:"193diwy",styles:'padding:10px 60px 10px 60px;@media (max-width: 420px){padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;}font-family:source-serif-pro,Georgia,Cambria,"Helvetica Neue","Arial Narrow",serif;text-rendering:optimizelegibility;font-weight:400'});function m(e){let{data:t,children:n}=e;const{mdx:a}=t,{frontmatter:o}=a;return"food"===o.category?r.createElement(s.A,{currentPage:"Interests",currentSubPage:"Food"},r.createElement(u.A,{title:o.title,keywords:o.keywords,description:o.description}),r.createElement(h,null,r.createElement(c,null,o.title),r.createElement(i.xA,null,n))):"theatre"===o.category?r.createElement(s.A,{currentPage:"Interests",currentSubPage:"Theatre Reviews"},r.createElement(u.A,{title:o.title+" - Review",keywords:o.keywords,description:o.description}),r.createElement(h,null,r.createElement(c,null,o.title),r.createElement(i.xA,null,n)),r.createElement("footer",{className:"footer go-center"},r.createElement("div",null,"---",o.date,"---"),r.createElement("div",{className:"lcars-bar-slice-bottom"}))):r.createElement(s.A,{currentPage:"Maria Mateescu",currentSubPage:"personal"===o.category?"Personal Log":"Engineering Log"},r.createElement(u.A,{title:o.title,keywords:o.keywords,description:o.description}),r.createElement(h,null,r.createElement(c,null,o.title),r.createElement(i.xA,null,n)),r.createElement("footer",{className:"footer go-center"},r.createElement("div",null,"---",o.date,"---"),r.createElement("div",{className:"lcars-bar-slice-bottom"})))}function d(e){return r.createElement(m,e,r.createElement(l,e))}},8453:function(e,t,n){n.d(t,{RP:function(){return r},xA:function(){return l}});var a=n(6540);const i=a.createContext({});function r(e){const t=a.useContext(i);return a.useMemo((()=>"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}),[t,e])}const o={};function l({components:e,children:t,disableParentContext:n}){let l;return l=n?"function"==typeof e?e({}):e||o:r(e),a.createElement(i.Provider,{value:l},t)}}}]);
