With the evolution of static code analysis, we now can find those references with greater ease. This enables us to make the safe decisions when tackling that code debt.

Most engineers nowadays do not work at the bleeding edge of technological discovery, what that means is that what they're trying to do has probably been done before. Maybe in a different way, but the building blocks are already there to be placed into a different shape that suits the new needs.

But a monorepo is closely linked with a culture of openness within the company. The fact that all developers can check out and read the entire repo, means all developers get to see and learn from all that their colleagues have done in the past. Which has countless benefits. But above all it fosters a culture of being able to fix things across the company. Sometimes there are small fixes that can be done in multiple places than just the small corner of the world of one's singular project, and the company benefits from them being propagated across the entire repository. Facebook had this famous motto of \\\"Nothing at Facebook is somebody else's problem.\\\" which I believe is one of the attitudes that allowed Facebook to become so successful and iterate so quickly.
