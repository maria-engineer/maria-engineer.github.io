(Imagine you were writing a message to a friend, two paragraphs in the release of a new frontend happens, and you loose all your progress because the JavaScript decided to update itself, and you need to start over... that would not be nice, would it?) When we are looking at Apps and SDK, depending on the users, while there are ways to block certain versions, this does not provide a good user experience. If we have a large user base, some might be in areas where internet is not as readily available, which means it is impossible for them to update their apps.

But you may ask "How does this make sense? The old code doesn\'t know what the new code is, if it did, we would have written the new code in the first place." Yes... and no. There are certain operations that however you write the code that will never be backwards compatible, regardless of how careful you are when changing them. Forwards compatibility is mostly trying to avoid those. I have seen it more often discussed in the context of engineering best practices than in a push safety context (these are not unrelated), and as a whole it is making your code more resilient to change. One example of better engineering practice that is backed by forwards compatibility is avoiding required fields in thrift structures or protobuffers. Forwards compatibility can rarely be gauged by looking at two different code versions, because if the next code version exists it\'s usually more of a question of backwards compatibility. So in code review or when coding in general, forwards compatibility is often a question of "How much of a nightmare will I have if I need to change this in the future?".'),"\n",s.createElement(t.p,null,'There is however one additional situation where forwards compatibility becomes an interesting question, and that is when forwards compatibility becomes backwards compatibility.

In my opinion, we should write code that always allows us to do that, because the old state should be "known good". When this revert happens, the old code is technically the new code in the discussion. If the code was forwards compatible, then it means the revert is backwards compatible, thus safe to roll back.
