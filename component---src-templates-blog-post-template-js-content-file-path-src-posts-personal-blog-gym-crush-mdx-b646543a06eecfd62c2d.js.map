We don't know this person, at all. And because of it, it's easy to project all the things we desire onto them. We can choose to make the craziest inferences based on the very little information their presence gives us. They don't even need to do anything. Crushes are rarely about other people, otherwise we'd genuinely like them, crushes are about what we desire, and this person's goal is to fit the fantasy well enough. They are filled with possibility, because we never take the chance to look and explore the reality, and that's what's so very tempting about them.
