I have discovered a passion for finding solutions that\n          will lead to better developer experience and increased efficiency,\n          both on a day to day basis, as well as part of operations. I've\n          greatly enjoyed exploring different solutions as I believe there isn't\n          one solution for everything, sometimes it's tools, sometimes it's\n          automation, sometimes is system design. Solving such problems is both\n          exciting and rewarding.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In my free time I enjoy a varied number of hobbies, from drawing, to\n          crochet, to most recently learning how to play trumpet.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Current Engagements</h2>\n        <p>\n          I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at{\" \"}\n          <a href=\"https://cord.com\" target=\"_blank\">\n            Cord\n          </a>\n          .
