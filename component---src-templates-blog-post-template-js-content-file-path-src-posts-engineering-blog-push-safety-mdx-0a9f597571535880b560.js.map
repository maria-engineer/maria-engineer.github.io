It refers to the code that the user decides when to update. The most obvious examples here are apps that need to be manually updated, or SDKs that need manual updating by an engineer. But another one people sometimes forget is front end JavaScript code. Browsers often cache the JavaScript for a page in order to make things faster and more reliable. (Imagine you were writing a message to a friend, two paragraphs in the release of a new frontend happens, and you loose all your progress because the JavaScript decided to update itself, and you need to start over... that would not be nice, would it?) When we are looking at Apps and SDK, depending on the users, while there are ways to block certain versions, this does not provide a good user experience. If we have a large user base, some might be in areas where internet is not as readily available, which means it is impossible for them to update their apps. So live with the knowledge that if something is mobile, there may be at least one user who will live with those changes forever, because at the end of the day we cannot force a change in something we do not control.\"), \"\\n\", React.createElement(_components.h2, null, \"What is push safety?\"), \"\\n\", React.createElement(_components.p, null, \"Push safety is a concept or practice that ensures we develop code in a way that does not break anything when we push new code.

One example of better engineering practice that is backed by forwards compatibility is avoiding required fields in thrift structures or protobuffers. Forwards compatibility can rarely be gauged by looking at two different code versions, because if the next code version exists it's usually more of a question of backwards compatibility.

So during that time you have people working on the old column, and some on the new one... In this case in particular the steps tend to be: create a new column; duplicate the data across both columns and have the code write to both at the same time, while still reading from the old one; start reading from the new one; when the old one stops being read from, stop writing into the old one; when the old one stops being written to, finally drop the old column.
