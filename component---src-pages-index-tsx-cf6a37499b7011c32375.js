My path felt almost predetermined—study at Oxford, work in tech... but something was missing.

That was a hard realisation for me because I always thought it was all about the maths. But I soon learned to love it. After experiencing several career shifts and life transitions, including living in New York, Cambridge, London, and now Seoul, I found coaching as a way to combine my problem-solving mindset with my desire to help others navigate change.
