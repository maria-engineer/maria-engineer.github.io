My coaching is rooted in my own journey of\n          navigating big transitions and challenges, from career shifts to\n          moving between countries. I've learned firsthand that the path to\n          meaningful change isn't about following a preset formula—it's about\n          uncovering what's truly important to you, and then aligning your\n          actions with those values.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          My approach isn't about giving you any answers. It's about helping you\n          find your own, whether you're facing a tough decision, feeling\n          overwhelmed by life's demands, or simply trying to figure out what's\n          next. I guide you through the process of clarity, uncovering the\n          underlying motivations and beliefs that shape your choices, so you can\n          make confident, informed decisions that reflect who you are and what\n          you want.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          I was steered toward Computer Science from an early age. My path felt\n          almost predetermined—study at Oxford, work in tech... but something\n          was missing. While I excelled in technical roles at companies like\n          Facebook, Amazon, I realized that the real challenges I faced were\n          human-centered—teams, decision-making, personal growth. That was a\n          hard realisation for me because I always thought it was all about the\n          maths. But I soon learned to love it. After experiencing several\n          career shifts and life transitions, including living in New York,\n          Cambridge, London, and now Seoul, I found coaching as a way to combine\n          my problem-solving mindset with my desire to help others navigate\n          change. Now, I guide professionals and leaders through the uncertainty\n          of growth, helping them align their decisions with their true values\n          and step into their next chapter with clarity and confidence.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <LinkButton\n            role=\"link\"\n            href=\"https://cal.com/maria-engineer/introduction-to-coaching\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            aria-label=\"Go to an external site where you can book my coaching sessions\"\n            tabindex=\"0\"\n          >\n            Work with me\n          </LinkButton>\n        </p>\n        <Credentials>\n          <a href=\"https://barefootcoaching.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">\n            <BarefootImage />\n          </a>\n          <a\n            href=\"https://www.credly.com/badges/eb2603e4-cadb-498c-87e5-a7770d14cdd4/public_url\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n          >\n            <ICFImage />\n          </a>\n        </Credentials>\n        <p>\n          When I'm not coaching, you'll find me exploring food, weightlifting,\n          hiking, reading, writing, and diving into tabletop role-playing\n          games or theater.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Past Engagements</h2>\n        <p>\n          I've had the privilege of working with some incredible organizations,\n          including:\n        </p>\n        <p>Reddit, Cord(now defunct), Thoughtworks, Facebook, Amazon, Google</p>\n        <p>\n          Each of these experiences shaped who I am today, both as a\n          professional and as a coach, and has fueled my drive to help others\n          thrive in their careers and lives.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>Contact</h2>\n        <p className=\"row\">\n          <a\n            href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-mateescu-1085b980\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            className=\"cornblue go-moonbeam small-button\"\n          >\n            <FontAwesomeIcon\n              icon={faLinkedin}\n              data-toggle=\"tooltip\"\n              title=\"Link to LinkedIn.\"\n            />\n          </a>\n          <a\n            className=\"cornblue go-moonbeam small-button\"\n            href=\"mailto:hi@maria.engineer\"\n          >\n            <FontAwesomeIcon\n              icon={faEnvelope}\n              data-toggle=\"tooltip\"\n              title=\"Email me.\"\n            />\n          </a>\n        </p>\n      </Layout>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":["MusicImage","___EmotionJSX","StaticImage","object","width","height","src","__imageData","require","BarefootImage","ICFImage","Gottman1Image","Gottman2Image","ProfileImage","IndexPage","React","SEO","title","Layout","currentPage","currentSubPage","LinkButton","role","href","target","tabindex","Credentials","className","FontAwesomeIcon","icon","faLinkedin","faEnvelope"],"sourceRoot":""}
