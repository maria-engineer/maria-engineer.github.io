My goal is to\n          create a safe, empowering space where clients feel supported and\n          confident in navigating life's complexities. I believe that, just like\n          in coding, the key to meaningful progress isn't fixing what's broken\n          but continuously refining, optimizing, and evolving.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          I hold a degree in Computer Science from Oxford University and have\n          worked across diverse engineering roles, from startups to industry\n          giants.

I have discovered a passion for finding solutions that\n          will lead to better developer experience and increased efficiency,\n          both on a day to day basis, as well as part of operations. I've\n          greatly enjoyed exploring different solutions as I believe there isn't\n          one solution for everything, sometimes it's tools, sometimes it's\n          automation, sometimes is system design. Solving such problems is both\n          exciting and rewarding.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In my free time I enjoy a varied number of hobbies like: drawing,\n          cooking, crochet, reading, writing, playing TTRPG games, and watching\n          theatre.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Past Engagements</h2>\n        <p>\n          Reddit,{\" \"}\n          <a href=\"https://cord.com\" target=\"_blank\">\n            Cord\n          </a>\n          , Thoughtworks, Facebook, Amazon, Google\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>Contact</h2>\n        <p className=\"row\">\n          <a\n            href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-mateescu-1085b980\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            className=\"cornblue go-moonbeam small-button\"\n          >\n            <FontAwesomeIcon\n              icon={faLinkedin}\n              data-toggle=\"tooltip\"\n              title=\"Link to LinkedIn.\"\n            />\n          </a>\n          <a\n            className=\"cornblue go-moonbeam small-button\"\n            href=\"mailto:hi@maria.engineer\"\n          >\n            <FontAwesomeIcon\n              icon={faEnvelope}\n              data-toggle=\"tooltip\"\n              title=\"Email me.\"\n            />\n          </a>\n        </p>\n      </Layout>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":["IndexPage","___EmotionJSX","React","SEO","title","Layout","currentPage","currentSubPage","href","target","LinkButton","role","tabindex","className","FontAwesomeIcon","icon","faLinkedin","faEnvelope"],"sourceRoot":""}
