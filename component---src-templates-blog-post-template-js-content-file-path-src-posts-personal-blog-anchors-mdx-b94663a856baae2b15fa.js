I lost my relationship, my job, my career, the house I owned, my cat, a large number of friends. I didn't even feel like I was in the right place in the world. My entire life was upended and everything I had thought about myself, and how my life would be like disappeared in an instant. (or certainly in what felt like an instant).

But for the first time, I had no one but myself to guide my plans. It was terrifying. I realised I never really had this much freedom, so I didn't really know what to do with it. I chose my university studies and my career path because of my parents, the city I lived in because of my partner, gave up on a lot of things I liked because of the people around me., I settled down my desire to see new places due to my cat.

I will immediately act and unbreak the situation. (Note: I used un-break, not fix, they're not the same) I immediately started applying for jobs, even though I knew I wasn't ready. I also knew it wasn't what I wanted to do. But how could I possibly not have a job, right? I had a job offer soon enough, but to quote a friend \"it had more red flags than the communist revolution\".

I was thinking about going travelling for a while, digital nomad style (or just tourist style), but dismissed it as it would have been detrimental to my relationship. As soon as my life imploded, I wanted to run away to Korea for a couple of months. But I didn't. Why? After all, I had nothing keeping me in London. A support system formed of a small number of friends, some of whom were already planning on moving away to the US, most of whom I primarily talked on messaging apps anyway. But I stayed.

I have come to the realisation that not only do I not need anchors, but I don't want them anymore.

Here comes my complete lack of knowledge of boats, but I will base the rest of this metaphor on my knowledge of Archimedes' principle. Anchors, however, are very heavy, they would need to be, I assume, however there is a limit to how much weight your boat can hold before sinking."),"\n",r.createElement(t.p,null,"Safety nets on the other hand are relatively light.
