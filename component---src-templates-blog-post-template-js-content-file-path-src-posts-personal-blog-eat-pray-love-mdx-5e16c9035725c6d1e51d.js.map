I remembered that being in Korea has been something I wanted since I was in high school, it just wasn't something I thought was even possible, so I never even considered it. But it could be, now. I had been in Seoul twice. I could make it possible. And if nothing I try is working out anyway, might as well let it not work out in a place I actually want to be.
