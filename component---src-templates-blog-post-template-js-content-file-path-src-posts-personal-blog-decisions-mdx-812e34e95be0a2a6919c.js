That may not sound like a decision, and in a way it isn't, but in other ways it is. It just has a level of commitment appropriate to the amount of information I have. When we first meet a person we get to know them (preferably quite well) before deciding to get married. Similarly, we keep our options open when we make decisions, avoiding irreversible decisions as much as possible. Yes, there will always be a cost, but the cost should match the level of commitment.
