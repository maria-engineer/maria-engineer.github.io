If we choose to pretend there is no hole in the house, then this is probably not seeing the house for what it is, and likely it cannot be love. Yes, roofs can sometimes be fixed. But with people, unlike with houses, the house needs to want to fix their own proverbial roof. We can help them along the way should they choose.
