Hence, the standard for a good post is something valuable, that I didn't know about, that can challenge my way of thinking, or just challenge me in general. Now if that is the definition of a good post, how could I possibly meet those standards in any post that I write. Anything that I write about will by default be something that is in line with my way of thinking, I know a lot about (hopefully), and does not particularly challenge me.

They were still good blog posts. And based on the responses some people did find them valuable and challenging. So check out some blog posts on topics you already know about. You'll be surprised.

But what it leads to, at least for me, is the pantomime trap of, it's obvious to me, and the people next to me, so it must be obvious to everyone... right? Wrong. Moving around with my job has made me realise that concepts that had become as simple as breathing to me, that everyone around me in my previous workplace had mastered, in different places they were novel.
