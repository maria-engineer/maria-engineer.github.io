It can be changes in business needs, it can be newly discovered security vulnerabilities, or just the plain old tech debt that is finally calling in to be paid. Having everything that could possibly call into your code into one place makes it a lot easier to check all your bases. With the evolution of static code analysis, we now can find those references with greater ease. This enables us to make the safe decisions when tackling that code debt. And the beauty of it is, in one repo, we often can make all this in 1 single pull request (sometimes 2, for push safety reasons, with the second being the clean-up)."),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,"Sure, nowadays, there are tools like SourceGraph that have made it easier to track this across repos, but there's a high chance that if I am making that change, I will not have all the repos that use my code checked out on my machine.

Most engineers nowadays do not work at the bleeding edge of technological discovery, what that means is that what they're trying to do has probably been done before. Maybe in a different way, but the building blocks are already there to be placed into a different shape that suits the new needs. When all these building blocks are scattered across many repos, some old and forgotten, it is difficult to find them. This leads to \"needing\" to reinvent the wheel every time. And that's not an easy feat."),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,"With monorepos finding the wheels that have already been invented, tried, tested, and gone through multiple improvement iterations becomes easier.

But a monorepo is closely linked with a culture of openness within the company. The fact that all developers can check out and read the entire repo, means all developers get to see and learn from all that their colleagues have done in the past. Which has countless benefits. But above all it fosters a culture of being able to fix things across the company. Sometimes there are small fixes that can be done in multiple places than just the small corner of the world of one's singular project, and the company benefits from them being propagated across the entire repository. Facebook had this famous motto of \"Nothing at Facebook is somebody else's problem.\" which I believe is one of the attitudes that allowed Facebook to become so successful and iterate so quickly. It encourages a culture of inclusion and acceptance of ideas from wherever they may come from. Thus, it creates a feeling of empowerment in its engineers.
