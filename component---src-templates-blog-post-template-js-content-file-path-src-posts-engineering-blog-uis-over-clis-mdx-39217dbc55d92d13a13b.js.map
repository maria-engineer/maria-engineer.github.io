However when someone tries to build an UI instead, they are made fun of. As a stubborn person I build it anyway, and then see just how much more accessible it is after the fact.

In an UI, your phone rings, you see the type of problem it is, go to the appropriate UI and then navigate with a few buttons and run the remediation you need. If it's anything more complicated than that you would have to write code and properly wake up anyway, in which case someone in a different timezone who is awake will be more capable to resolve the problem anyway. And if they don't it can wait until you are fully awake. With a CLI, taking into account the time to go get your laptop, type in your secure password, log in to VPN and all the other steps you need to take to just get to the secure terminal means at least 20 minutes until you can even start considering what to do.

Onboarded.\"), \"\\n\", React.createElement(_components.p, null, \"But let's also look at the level of competency this new person would need to have. As Operating Systems are becoming more and more UI centric, CLIs become less of a necessary skill to have. Like complaining that a 16 year old kid cannot operate a rotary phone... well, they don't really need to. So CLIs become restrictive in the types of people who can use them. And it's not only about hiring, but also about enabling other teams to unblock themselves, easily.

As systems scale the tools to deal with them become increasingly more complex. As a result the CLIs for them grow. I've seen these go one of two ways: Either the number of arguments increases so much you have to have another script automatically generate the arguments for you. Then you copy paste the script it gives you and continue. Or you have an exponential increase of scripts and you need to remember which one does which, and your average command it three scripts piped together. At the same the manual gets so big you just couldn't read it all every time you need to do something. It comes to a point where the options you want to pass in become large enums that a dropdown menu would be invaluable to make sure you got it right.\"), \"\\n\", React.createElement(_components.h2, null, \"Reason 4: UIs tend to be more findable\"), \"\\n\", React.createElement(_components.p, null, \"One cannot overestimate the importance of just having a link to a tool.

It is technically possible... technically...\"), \"\\n\", React.createElement(_components.p, null, \"Especially in the context of operations but not limited to, I have often found that additional context is required to make the right decision. So we go full hacker mode with 5 screens each holding different information that is required to know which command to fill in next... one of which holds the documentation of the command. I have seen people who have spend weeks in trying to use a graphical interface in their CLI to show them the graph that will tell them which path to take... to which I can only say... why?
