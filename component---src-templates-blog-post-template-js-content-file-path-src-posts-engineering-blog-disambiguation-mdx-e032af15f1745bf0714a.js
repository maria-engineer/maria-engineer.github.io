In my experience, if I use 50% of my work week writing code, that is a lot. I think I may have achieved that a few times, and they were all in the context of hackathons. Most of the job is communicating: with your fellow engineers, the designers, management, cross-functional partners, users, etc. That is often to determine the answer to the question such as "What should I be doing?" or my preferred version "What is the problem I am trying to solve?".

These gates can then be combined to do specific operations like addition.

Personally I would not be too concerned. With the use of similar technologies, auto-completes in IDEs have been getting more and more useful. When autocomplete appeared, automatically filling in the name of the functions no engineer lost their job.

What you then have: is just another compiler. Then instead of using JavaScript as a language in which the engineer communicates to the computer, they use spoken English, that the LLM translates to JavaScript that then gets translated to Machine Instructions, eventually. But, as we are already seeing in the increase of talks about prompt engineering as a buzzword and study, that English we will use to "speak" to the LLM is likely not going to be the same as we use when speaking with each other, at least if we want to get the desired results.

Each iteration clarifies the problem further until there is one single set of instructions, the code, but the disambiguation does not stop there, once the engineer writes the code, the compiler translates it to a set of instructions that get sent to the processor, and then there are a lot of electrons firing in circuits.
