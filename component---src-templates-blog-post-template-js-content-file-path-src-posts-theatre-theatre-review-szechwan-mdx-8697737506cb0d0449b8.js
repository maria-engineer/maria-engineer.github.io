I would describe it as loud and chaotic, yet entertaining and fresh. Considering they took a highly intellectual play by Brecht that some may consider dry, and turned it into something fun and probably enjoyable for the masses, while also not losing the message of the play, is impressive in its own right."),"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,"I enjoyed what they did with Brecht's signature alienation effect.

Many conversations were had about the (I believe) second appearance of the gods and how it was possible. (If I got the count wrong, it should be obvious which one I am referring to once you see it.) The rest of the set itself is a work of art, from the LED pool noodles (for lack of a better name) to the power socket, and from the gods' exit to the gods' entrances. The costumes were also fantastic, with personal favourites being the frog and the rat."),"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,"In terms of modernization, I have mixed feelings. While the topics of morals and capitalism that are the overarching themes of the play still apply today, there are a few things that may not translate as well. The presence of Shen Te and her alter ego Shui Ta is comedic and absurd, yet while I still believe that the difference between the two sadly still makes a difference in how they are treated, I am willing to pass the simplicity of the difference as well as its unrealism as a product of the time and the fact that this is supposedly a satire. I really struggled to figure out the inflation calculations for the money values, such as the rent being 200$ for 6 months, yet the bottle of water being 18$."),"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,"Overall, I believe I enjoyed the play.
