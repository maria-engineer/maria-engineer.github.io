It will take a little while to pass, and until then, I won't do anything I can't take back. Once I am back on fully rational soil, then I can start analysing what actually happened. People pleasing can give a negative perspective even to positive things sometimes. After all it's best to assume the worst, right? So, it's best to clarify things when you have calmed down.
