It's set to be a cozy healing fantasy, yet it poses an interesting question: \"If you could, what memories would you choose to forget?\". Honestly, I like having control of my life. As I cannot say how I would look like if I didn't remember certain things, regardless how unpleasant, I found this hard.

Sometimes a memory has such a strong stress response that our brain suppresses or reconsolidates it differently, making it less accessible to conscious recall. While it may seem 'erased' from our perspective, these memories may continue to influence us in subtle ways even when we can't directly access them.

So, as time goes on, a painful memory should become less painful. Now, this can sometimes go wrong. This is a common cause for PTSD and cPTSD, where the memory remains connected to the emotional/survival response.

There are things I only recently managed to repair, yet I know how they were broken over and over again as I was trying to repair them while being in the wrong environment.
