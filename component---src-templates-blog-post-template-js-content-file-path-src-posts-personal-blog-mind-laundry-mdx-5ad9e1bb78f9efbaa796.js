It's set to be a cozy healing fantasy, yet it poses an interesting question: \"If you could, what memories would you choose to forget?\". Honestly, I like having control of my life.

Sometimes a memory has such a strong stress response that our brain suppresses or reconsolidates it differently, making it less accessible to conscious recall.
