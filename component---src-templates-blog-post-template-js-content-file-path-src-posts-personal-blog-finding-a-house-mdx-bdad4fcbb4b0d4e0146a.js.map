And another that was listed with 5 different ages, all at different times (and some research showed on the oldest one it had been on the market for a year). The longer it has been on the market the more one can tell about it. Sometimes they are very wrong things that come out in surveys, sometimes the sellers are asking too much and won't budge. Asking the agent will rarely let you know how long a place has been on the market as it is not in their interest to reveal that.

Sometimes they're not very good and they can't, I've chosen to outright avoid those agents. We once looked at a freehold, that we found out from another agent's listing that it had a service charge. The agent was unable to give us details on it but confirmed it existed. If the place is on a private road, is there a maintenance charge? What happens if you don't pay it?

We made an initial offer of a bit less. As they themselves had only bought it 4 years before, we made an offer that we estimated to be house cost + stamp duty.
