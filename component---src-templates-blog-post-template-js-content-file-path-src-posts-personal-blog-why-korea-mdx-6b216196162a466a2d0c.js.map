He said that the way I show ambition makes it seem like we are competing, and he doesn't like a competitive culture. It was just the two of us in the team at that time. Ask any ambitious woman, and they will have a story if not many stories about how their ambition was portrayed as a flaw. There's a certain level of conformism in companies in the UK and to a similar extent Silicon Valley (if you are a woman). While I have not experienced that many workplaces in total, being eager, ambitious and generally competent, have rarely been seen as qualities. I have seen two types of women in the field of tech, the ambitious women who strive harder and harder, some get lucky and make some progress, but a lot more burn out due to too much work, and little recognition.

In American or British school dramas, the smartest kid is usually geeky, socially awkward, and bullied. In Korean dramas? The smartest student is often a lead character, admired for their intelligence, and, of course, played by an absurdly attractive actor. Because, if they are perfectly smart, of course they'd be perfectly good-looking. People are drawn to them and revere them.
