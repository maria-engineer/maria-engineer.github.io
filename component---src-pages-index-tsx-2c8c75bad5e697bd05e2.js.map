I have discovered a passion for finding solutions that\n          will lead to better developer experience and increased efficiency,\n          both on a day to day basis, as well as part of operations. I've\n          greatly enjoyed exploring different solutions as I believe there isn't\n          one solution for everything, sometimes it's tools, sometimes it's\n          automation, sometimes is system design. Solving such problems is both\n          exciting and rewarding.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In my free time I enjoy a varied number of hobbies, from drawing, to\n          crochet, to most recently learning how to play trumpet.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Current Engagements</h2>\n        <p>\n          I am currently working as a Software Engineer in Site Reliability on\n          Google Cloud.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Past Engagements</h2>\n        <p>\n          <a href=\"https://cord.com\" target=\"_blank\">\n            Cord\n          </a>\n          , Thoughtworks, Facebook, Amazon, Google\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>Contact</h2>\n        <p className=\"row\">\n          <a\n            href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-mateescu-1085b980\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            className=\"cornblue go-moonbeam small-button\"\n          >\n            <FontAwesomeIcon\n              icon={faLinkedin}\n              data-toggle=\"tooltip\"\n              title=\"Link to LinkedIn.\"\n            />\n          </a>\n          <a\n            className=\"cornblue go-moonbeam small-button\"\n            href=\"mailto:hi@maria.engineer\"\n          >\n            <FontAwesomeIcon\n              icon={faEnvelope}\n              data-toggle=\"tooltip\"\n              title=\"Email me.\"\n            />{\" \"}\n          </a>\n        </p>\n      </Layout>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":["ProfileImage","S","className","imgClassName","width","height","title","alt","src","IndexPage","currentPage","currentSubPage","href","target","icon","faLinkedin","faEnvelope"],"sourceRoot":""}
